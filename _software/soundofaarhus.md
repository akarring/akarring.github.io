## Fall 2020

A map of Aarhus made in collaboration with the students of Digital Design 3rd semester Fall 2020. The students got the task to walk a "DÃ©rive"  - a city walk guided by their senses, in this case, their hearing. Whenever they met an unexpected sound or a very characteristic sound of that place in the city, they were asked to recorded and note down where the audio was recorded. I put this together as our collective map of Aarhus that we used in the class.

The program was written in p5.js.
