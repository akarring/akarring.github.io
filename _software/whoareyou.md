## Spring 2019

This is a program that I presented at Processing Community Day 2019.

The program displays a completely black background, onto which circles in different colours will appear, together with text connected to the circles, with information about: age, gender and emotion. These circles are representations of the people that are captured through a connected webcam.. These circles will move and change colour and shape depending of the people in front of the webcam. with the use of Facial-recognition software, determines and displays the program information about the people in front of the webcam. Even though no webcam footage is visible on screen, the program will occationally and without warning take pictures and save the pictures locally on the computer.

The program is meant to reflect the pros and cons of surveillance in combination with facial recognition and also a reflection on these assumptions and abstractions, which the AI in the facial recognition software needs to make to be able to use the captured data.
