## Spring 2016

As a reflection on algorithms, this program is a simple construction, of simple lines, for which the only rules are that they either split in two or continue. The same
code is repeated for the trunk as for the branches by calling the same function inside the function(recursion), but with a slight variation with the help of the random function. Try pressing the tree followed by a key on your keyboard to generate a new tree.

The program was originally written in Processing.
