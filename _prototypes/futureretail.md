## Autumn 2018
*Made in collaboration with:  Ida Reinholdt Jensen, Anders Jensen and Sebastian Knudsen.*

My group and I made a Virtual Video Prototype by using the blue studio, provided by CAVI, a research center at Aarhus University. We made a scenario of a virtual store, that could change appearance according to a theme every week. The example shown in the video being Chinese culture.
