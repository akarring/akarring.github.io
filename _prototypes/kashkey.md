### KashKey keychain

My group and I wanted to create a design that gave children an easier relation with their "digital money", than what our field studies showed they had. This design is a keychain that keeps track of the child's account and makes it easier for the child to calculate future investments. The video displayed a functional prototype, that is an oversized version of the design envisioned.

### KashKey Plant

This design is made together with the KashKey keychain, that is also displayed on this site. The plant can scan a child's KashKey keychain, and then the plant will display a representation of the child's current economic status. If the child is doing well economically, the plant will rise high, and opposite, if their economy is doing badly.
