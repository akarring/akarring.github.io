## Spring 2019

This project is the result of attending the course Design as a Critical Practice during my master's.

We all die some day. The Death plan was created to provoke people of all ages to reflect on their wishes for what they want to happen with their body the day they dies, as well as informing them about the consequences of the choices they make for their burial.

This project was exhibited at dokk1 during Internet Week Denmark 2019 as part of a collection together with the [Undertaken App](#LINK).
