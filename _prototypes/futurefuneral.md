## Spring 2019

*Made in collaboration with Søren Sjøstand Madsen*

This project was done at a hackathon when I attended the course "Design as Critical Practice".

Inspired by "death cities", like catacombs and necropolis this design is imagined in a future, where graveyards as we know them as a place for mourning no longer exists. In this future there is a need for a new mourning ritual that memorizes deceased loved ones. This ritual follows the following steps:

1) Place your hand into the sacrificial box, that will open a wound in your hand and register the blood sacrifice.

2) Visual and auditory memories of the deceased will start playing.

3) Clean your wounded hand in the bowl of water, dry your hand and use the gauze to bind the hand.

The actual prototype were powered by an arduino uno with a FSR that triggers two vibrator motors when pressed. This were placed inside the box together with a mixture of syrup and red food die to simulate blood.

What the video below to see it in action.
