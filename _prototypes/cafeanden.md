The café spirit (caféånden), that you can see move on different facades in the city. It evolves and moves according to how much the citizens of the city lift their cups and glasses on the cafés of the city, all while talking, listening, thinking, working and fooling around. The pixel animal mirrors the spirit of the cafés all around the city live. In that way you can experience the pulse of the city and the life on the cafés in the urban setting of the city, and thereby making the activity ubiquitous and unconsciously experienced in all of the city.

Watch the video below to get the experience of caféånden.
