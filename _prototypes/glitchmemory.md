## Summer 2018

*A project by Ann Light, Annette Markham, & Mórna O’Connor from the Museum of Random Memory (MoRM) from the research project "Creating future memory".*

I helped Annette Markham by programming some of and setting up the physical installation of this project at Godsbanen in Aarhus. The installation is a video of Annette Markham interviewing a woman in her 70's that "donates" a memory about wartime privation in her small Jutland town 65 years ago. In the physical installation the video is connected to a kinect sensor, that registers any viewer of the video. The closer the viewer stands to the screen, the more glitched and distorted will the video become.
