## 9th of May 2019

When I attended the course "Design as a Critical Practice" as a student, my fellow students and I exhibited the products we made during this course at dokk1 as part of Internet Week Denmark 2019 (IWDK). IWDK chose to interview me about the product I was exhibiting for their social media.
