Processing Community Day (PCD) is a yearly international event originally created by the processing foundation. The people behind the event in Aarhus are the programming group code&share, which is a community for people interested in programming in Aarhus.

PCD was created as a day to celebrate art, code and diversity. In Aarhus this means inviting people that has made some interesting projects and let them give a talk on their project, process and motivation for coding. [Read more about PCD here.](https://www.pcdaarhus.net/)

In 2021 I helped arrange PCD as part of the group mentioned above. This included getting in contact with speakers, arranging catering, booking the venue etc.
