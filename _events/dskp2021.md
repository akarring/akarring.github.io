## 16th of November 2021

I arranged this event in collaboration with my students when I taught the course "Design as a Critical Practice". The purpose of the event was to exhibit the products the students had made throughout the semester.

The students and I were interviewed by BURT (b√∏rn og Unge regional TV) during the exhibition, and their program about the exhibit can be seen below.
