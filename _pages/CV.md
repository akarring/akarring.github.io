## Private Life

I am 26 years old and use she/they pronouns. I have an interest in music and dance. In my spare time I participate in the group code&share, which is a community for people interested in programming in Aarhus. I am fluent in Danish, English and German and now I am practicing my Portuguese. Through the last 21 years I have danced ballet and played violin. I am passionate about equal rights for everyone regardless of gender, ethnicity, or sexuality.
