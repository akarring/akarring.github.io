## Fall 2018

*Made in collaboration with:  Ida Reinholdt Jensen, Anders Jensen and Sebastian Knudsen*

My group and I used the blue studio, provided by CAVI, a research center at Aarhus University to make this project. We wanted to explore the effects of inviting users into the blue studio, so they could see themselves in real-time in a new virtual alternative to what they are used to. The design was specifically meant as an event at Busgaden in Aarhus. So we wanted to explore the use of the blue studio at CAVI for the design activity scenarios. So instead of recording a virtual video prototype in the blue studio and then show it to users, we wanted to bring users into the blue studio. We tested 3 different ways of interacting with our design on 2x2 users in the blue studio.

The following video illustrates the interactions the users could perform in the virtual video prototype.
