## Fall 2018

### Teaching through the Arduino development environment

One of the main tasks of my job as a student programmer in the Digital Design Lab  at Aarhus University was to introduce relevant courses to physical computing. We do this most often through the use of Arduino.
I made an Arduino library, to make it a little easier and more rewarding for beginners to learn how to program physical computing components.
