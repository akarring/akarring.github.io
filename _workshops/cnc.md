## Spring 2019

### CNC-carving, 3D-printing and Lasercutting

Throughout my time as a student programmer at the Digital Design Lab I have planned and held a vast amount of workshops, introducing university students to CNC machines. This include 3D modelling, printing and carving and lasercutting.

I made a guide on how to safely and responsibly use of the two carving machines we had at the time of my employment in DD lab, which I also build and setup myself. I created the guide below as a basis for making workshops in carving.
