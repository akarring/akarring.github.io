## Fall 2015

*Made in collaboration with: Simone Boye, Alexander Kracht and Leopold Corneliusen*

This workshop tested a mock-up with users. The design that was tested tried to make it more attractive to be at Vesterbro torv in Aarhus with the use of an interactive screen.
In our design, the screen was connected to other screens in other cities. When people passed by, they would get notified about adventurous quests to do around town.
