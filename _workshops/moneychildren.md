## Spring 2017

*Made in collaboration with: Helena Naumov Rasmussen, Sabrina Kj√¶rager Larsen and Julya Konelskaya Raimensborg.*

This was a workshop that was used for researching children's relationship with money. Two 11-year old children were invited to the workshop to walk through how they currently meet money in their everyday lives. This was done through an interactive prototype, that was designed to be based on video game theory, and other elements of the workshop were also based on the concept of play.
