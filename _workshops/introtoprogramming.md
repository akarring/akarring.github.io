## Spring 2020

### Teaching creative code through the Processing and P5.js coding environments.

Throughout most of my time in university I worked as a teacher's assistant in the course Aesthetic programming. In this course, my task was to help the students in the most pedagogical way, in their process of learning the basics of programming and aesthetic reflection on code and software. Every week we went through the new syntax and discussed the theme of the week, followed by a session, where the students coded and could get help when needed.

In April 2017 I started working in the Digital Design Lab (DD Lab), where I also make workshops that introduce students to programming. For instance, have I made and documented a 3x3 hour introduction course to programming in Processing for beginners.
